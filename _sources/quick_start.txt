Quick start
===========

Scikit-learn-speed is a continuous benchmarking suite that accompanies the 
`scikit-learn <http://www.scikit-learn.org/>`_ project. It is built on top of
`vbench <http://wesmckinney.com/blog/?p=373>`_.

Dependencies
------------

In order to run the benchmarks, you must have the following packages installed:

  - The development version of vbench from `Vlad's repository <https://github.com/vene/vbench/tree/abstract_benchmarks>`_.
  - `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_, `Scipy <http://scipy.org/>`_

Vbench itself requires:

  - `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ (it should be in the path, old versions might fail)
  - `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ (and its dependencies)
  - `sqlalchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_
  - `memory_profiler <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler>`_ (optional, for memory usage benchmarking)
  - `line_profiler <http://packages.python.org/line_profiler>`_ (optional, for line profiling)

For building the web pages (that you are looking at right now), you
additionally need:

  - `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
  - `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_


Installation
------------

Just fetch the latest code from the `Github repository <https://github.com/vene/scikit-learn-speed/>`_.

Running the benchmarks
----------------------

In order to run the benchmarks on your own machine, you need to:

1. Clone the repository somewhere, for example ``~/code/scikit-learn-speed``

2. Extract the datasets::

    cd ~/code/scikit-learn-speed/benchmarks
    tar jxvf data.tar.bz2


3. Create the configuration file ``~/.vbench-skl``. For example::

    [setup]
    repo_path = /Users/vene/code/scikit-learn
    repo_url = git@github.com:scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
    db_path = /Users/vene/code/scikit-learn-speed/benchmarks/benchmarks.db
    tmp_dir = /tmp/vb_sklearn


The values displayed above are hardcoded defaults, and they are used in case
the configuration value doesn't exist, or to override skipped values.
Specifically, this means you don't have to bother to set ``repo_url`` and
``tmp_dir``.


4. From the ``scikit-learn-speed`` folder, run ``make``. This will call:

 - ``make run``, which runs the benchmark suite,
 - ``make rst``, which generates the Sphinx sources for the reports,
 - ``make html``, which builds the HTML reports from the sources.

For more details about other ``make`` options, type ``make help``. At the
moment, the ``quick`` flag is passed by default, which means it only runs the
``linear_model`` benchmarks, as a test that everything works OK. Another flag
is ``historical``, which makes vbench go behind in time and run the suite on
more releases, but this takes a long time. To pass this kinds of flags, just
set the ``SKL_SPEED_ARGS`` environment variable. For example::

  SKL_SPEED_ARGS='quick historical' make


The result of ``make run`` is a file called ``benchmarks.db`` in the 
``benchmarks`` folder (or wherever you pointed the ``db_path`` setting to).
You can look inside this file using ``sqlite3`` or better, by instanciating a
``vbench.db.BenchmarksDB`` object, like this:

.. code-block:: python

	In [1]: from vbench.db import BenchmarkDB

	In [2]: db = BenchmarkDB('benchmarks/benchmarks.db')

	In [3]: db.get_benchmarks()
	Out[3]: 
	                                                                           name description

Generating the documentation
----------------------------

To only generate the HTML files from the database, navigate to the
``scikit-learn-speed`` folder and execute::

    make rst   # this generates the Sphinx sources
    make html  # this builds the HTML reports

You can view the results by opening
``scikit-learn-speed/benchmarks/build/html/index.html`` in your favourite
internet browser. An internet connection is recommended, because JQuery and
JQueryUI are loaded from Google's CDN.
